Deep learning techniques have proven successful in Computer Vision for its adaptability to capture the minute information in any data. But it is less studied in relational networks. Recent papers tried to incorporate deep learning techniques on single attribute single relational data where they get the embeddings of the nodes and based on those embeddings, one can do collective classification, link prediction, anomaly detection and various others methods which requires feature vector representations. I focus on extending deep learning techniques to learn the embedding of single-attribute multi-relational (SAMR) data for which till recent time, very few papers has been published. I propose two novel architectures which learns embedding in SAMR data and using which I focus on problems of link prediction and collective classification.
