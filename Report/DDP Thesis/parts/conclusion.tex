\section{Conclusion}
 
\section{Criticism and Possible Future Work}
Thus I have proposed two simple frameworks to address multi-relational network problem. They are capable to use the existing deepwalk model \cite{deepwalk} with an expense of additional computation required to get the information across the relations. The normal deepwalk code which is available in online is CPU based. So I'll try to use converted tensorflow based deepwalk in GPU for scalability.
